    "# Hund's Rule and Electron Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distribution of electrons within an atom is pivotal in grasping chemical properties and behaviors. In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule (or other physical structure) in atomic or molecular orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomic Orbitals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are they?**  \n",
    "  Atomic orbitals provide a mathematical way to describe the likely location of an electron around a nucleus. They give us a probability distribution for the electron, which is typically represented in shapes (spheres, dumbbells, etc.) where the electron is likely to be found.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Types of Orbitals:**\n",
    "  - **s-orbital:** Spherical shape, can hold up to 2 electrons.\n",
    "  - **p-orbital:** Dumbbell shape, can hold up to 6 electrons.\n",
    "  - **d-orbital:** Complex shape, can hold up to 10 electrons.\n",
    "  - **f-orbital:** More complex shape, can hold up to 14 electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Numbers:**  \n",
    "  These numbers describe the state of an electron in an atom. Each electron is described by four quantum numbers:  \n",
    "  - **Principal Quantum Number (n):** Specifies the energy level (shell) of an electron in an atom and its size.\n",
    "  - **Azimuthal Quantum Number (l):** Defines the shape of the orbital, and also defines the subshell.\n",
    "  - **Magnetic Quantum Number (mₗ):** Describes the orientation of the orbital in space.\n",
    "  - **Spin Quantum Number (mₛ):** Describes the spin direction of the electron (-½ or +½).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hund's Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Hund’s Rule, established by Friedrich Hund in 1925, guides the arrangement of electrons within the same subshell. It defines that:\n",
    "1. **Maximum Multiplicity:** Electrons prefer to inhabit different orbitals in a subshell with parallel spins to maximize total spin before pairing up.\n",
    "2. **Electron Repulsion:** Electrons are negatively charged and hence repel each other. Spreading out into different orbitals minimizes this repulsion.\n",
    "3. **Stable Configuration:** Electrons configure themselves to provide the most stable arrangement within an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "Consider the p-orbitals which can hold a maximum of 6 electrons. According to Hund’s rule, each p-orbital will first be singly occupied by electrons with parallel spins before any pairing occurs.\n",
