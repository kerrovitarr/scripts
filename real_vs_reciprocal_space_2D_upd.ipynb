    "## Theoretical Background for the Lattice Visualization Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided script is a visual exploration tool for understanding lattice structures, reciprocal lattice vectors, and the Brillouin Zone in two dimensions. Below is the theoretical backdrop pertaining to the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lattice Structures in 2D:\n",
    "A lattice is a periodic arrangement of points in space, with each point having an identical surrounding to every other point. In two dimensions, a lattice can be described by two non-collinear vectors $ \\mathbf{a}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{a}_2 $, called the primitive lattice vectors. These vectors define a unit cell which, when repeated periodically in space, forms the entire lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reciprocal Lattice:\n",
    "The reciprocal lattice is a construct that plays a crucial role in the analysis of wave phenomena in crystalline materials. It is defined such that the dot product of a real space lattice vector and a reciprocal space lattice vector equals $2\\pi$ times an integer. The reciprocal lattice vectors $ \\mathbf{b}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{b}_2 $ in 2D are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{b}_1 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2}{\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{b}_2 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1}{\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot (\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\mathbf{R} $ is a 90-degree rotation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brillouin Zone:\n",
    "The first Brillouin Zone is defined as the set of points in reciprocal space that are closer to the origin of the reciprocal lattice than to any other reciprocal lattice points. It's a crucial concept for understanding wave-vector dependent phenomena in crystals, like electron and phonon dispersion relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Functions:\n",
    "- `get_reciprocal_vectors(a1, a2)`: Computes the reciprocal lattice vectors based on the input real space lattice vectors.\n",
    "- `plot_lattice(v1, v2, nb_x, nb_y, add_brillouin)`: Plots the real space lattice and optionally the first Brillouin zone.\n",
    "- `interactive_lattice_plot(a1, a2, theta)`: Interactive function to visualize the real and reciprocal space lattices based on the user's input for the lattice parameters and the angle between the lattice vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Workflow:\n",
    "1. The script initializes with an interactive widget allowing the user to specify the norms of the real space lattice vectors $a_1$ and $a_2$, and the angle $ \\theta $ between them.\n",
    "2. Upon interaction, `interactive_lattice_plot` function is called, which computes the real space lattice vectors $ \\mathbf{v}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{v}_2 $ based on the provided parameters.\n",
    "3. `plot_lattice` function is then called twice, once for plotting the real space lattice and once for plotting the reciprocal space lattice.\n",
    "4. Optionally, the first Brillouin zone can also be plotted in the real space lattice plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script serves as a valuable tool for visualizing and understanding the fundamental concepts of lattice structures, reciprocal lattice, and Brillouin zone in two-dimensional crystalline materials.\n"
